* #26: Added filtering of assignments for sequences contained in other ones
* Restructured code with the new modular bundles from the db.rnacentral-library:
  now the DB release process is split in three steps: filter1 -> filter2 -> generate
* Some refactoring and optimizations for the filter1 (of unrelated sequences)
