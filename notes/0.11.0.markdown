This release changes both the data generated and its structure.

- #52 FASTA headers now are `gnl|${db_name}|${id}`, following NCBI conventions
- #49 sequences with a significant number of `N`s are excluded
- #50 down to requiring 99% of query coverage in the drop inconsistent assignments step

Apart from this there are various documentation improvements.
